	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>This project started as a way for me to experiment with two new things, the HTML5 canvas 
		and Microsoft's new TypeScript compiler. What the project has become is a small but growing
		set of reusable dashboard controls.</p>

	<p>While cDash is implemented in Typescript the output of the compiler is vanilla javascript, so
		these controls can be used in any web project with only a basic knowledge of Javascript.</p>

	<p>However, the libraries reliance on the HTML5 browser control means that the controls will only
		work on up-to-date browsers. The following browsers are all up to spec:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Safari 4.0+</li>
		<li>Firefox 6.0+</li>
		<li>Chrome 10+</li>
		<li>Opera 10+</li>
		<li>IE 9+<sup>**</sup></li>
	</ul>

<p><sup>**</sup>For IE 8 and older you could try using the controls in association with the <a href="http://flashcanvas.net">Flash canvas</a> plugin. </p>

	<h1>License</h1>
	<p>I've tried to license the code in as permissive a manner as possible. Please free to use these controls in your projects both personal and commercial.
