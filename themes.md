I'm not (as you can tell!) a graphics person. These themes are included as an indication of what can be achieved. If you want to create a theme and contribute it back. Please do so, I'd be very grateful. You can design a theme in the [Theme Park](/themePark)

		
<select id="themeSelector"></select>

<div class="excent">
	<canvas  id="dashboard" width="1000" height="400"></canvas>
	<canvas id="marquee" width="800" height="28"></canvas>
</div>
