# License

Arghh, It's the legalise! (panic not, the bullet points summarize it nicely)

I want this project to be as open and unlimited as possible, so this project (or at least the code I wrote) is released under the MIT License. 
Currently all third party licenses used by code supporting the cDash project also use the same licensing terms (reproduced below for 
completeness and many thanks to the respective authors, open source builds on open source).
	
*	The long and the short of it is:
*	Do with it as you see fit
*	Include it in open source projects
*	Include it in Closed source / commercial projects
*	_But don't sue me_ if it's not to your satisfaction
